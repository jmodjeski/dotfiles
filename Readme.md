# Dotfiles

## Inspiration
https://dotfiles.github.io

## Methodology
I tend to favor minimalism.  For example, oh-my-zsh seems like a great framework, community driven what more could someone ask.  IMHO, I'd rather pick and choose my stuff as needed.  Flair is great, but I just prefer to expect the normal until I change it.

While I'm putting this on github, it really is for selfish reasons.  I just want to be able to keep my dotfiles in sync across personal and work environments.

For that reason, PR's will only be accepted to patch security flaws and features that I find extraordinarily useful (rare cases).

Everything else added here is most likely *stolen with attribution* then tweaked to meet my needs.
